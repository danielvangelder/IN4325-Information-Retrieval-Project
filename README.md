##### `Authors:` Thomas Bos (xxxxxxx) & DaniÃ«l van Gelder (4551028), group 7

This is the repository for the implementation of the IR project for the TU Delft MSc course IN4325 Information Retrieval. In this project we implement two baselines for a Passage Ranking task and perform an analysis of the results.

## Prerequisites:
- Python 3.7.x
- Pandas (latest)
- Numpy (latest)
- jupyter notebook (latest)
- Download the [TREC 2019 Deep Learning Track Passage Ranking Dataset](https://microsoft.github.io/msmarco/TREC-Deep-Learning-2019#passage-ranking-dataset) and place the following (extracted) files in the `src/data` folder:
    - Collection
    - Queries
    - All Test files

Activate the virtual environment in the `venv` folder to start a python environment with the appropriate dependencies.
