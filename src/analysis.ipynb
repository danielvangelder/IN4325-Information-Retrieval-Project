Those are words that humans would know are related to military suicides, but such a system would not be aware of that.

Some of the common mistakes that have been observed are that documents are found that match only a part of the query. In addition, the tokenization of the queries may remove crucial information from the query. When looking at queries that the model has missed, it seems that these queries often contain terms that are very much related to the query but are not in the query.
